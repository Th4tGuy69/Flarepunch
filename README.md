Thanks for downloading Flarepunch.
This README will be filled out properly in due time.

**Please Note:** The HUD is not complete, and there is still work to be done. Feedback and suggestions are appreciated, and can be left on the [teamfortress.tv forums](https://huds.tf/forum/showthread.php?tid=2) for now.

There is an in-built Streamer Mode that turns off player names, although it is incomplete at the moment. Please let me know what I've missed.

You can turn on Streamer Mode by using cl_hud_minmode 1.

Make sure you're not using minmode if you want to see player names.

##Suggested Config Commands:

tf_hud_target_id_alpha 255

tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 1

tf_hud_show_servertimelimit 1

##STREAMER MODE:

cl_hud_killstreak_display_time 0
